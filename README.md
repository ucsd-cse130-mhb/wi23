# practice problems repo

You can clone this repo and work on the problems in `src`. There are solutions
in `sol`, but they are not the only way to solve these problems.

If you're using the Haskell extension in VSCode, you can click "Refresh" above
the `-- >>>` lines to run those test cases in the file.

Alternatively, you can use the test suite. Running `make lecx`, where `x` is
the lecture you're working on, will run the tests for that lecture. For example,
`make lec7` will run the tests for lecture 7. Running `make`, or `stack test`,
will run all the tests.
